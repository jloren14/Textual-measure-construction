# Textual-measure-construction
The repository contains the data and R script with the solution to the problem I was given during the course "Applied Textual Data Analysis" at NHH Norwegian School of Economics. The task was to construct a textual measure that predicts the political party of a politician in the US based on their speech in congress.
